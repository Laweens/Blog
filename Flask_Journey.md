<h1>Flask Intro</h1>
My jouney with flask in short has been complicated since i started out unfimilar with it and im a beginner when it comes to programming in general.

Flask is a webframe in Python that makes it far less work for the user to create dynamic web applications. Flask has some huge benefits that make it much different from Html and css, for example html and css run only in the users web browser, meaning no changes done by the user will be shared back. Just that feature alone allows flask to be so much more flexible, If you wish to have users sign in to a website the information can be sent to a database and saved with flask unlike html and css. Flask is backend so its only accesible by the developers keeping information private.

<h1> Resources used to help with Flask</h1>

A resource I used was the old reliable, Youtube, there's always videos on youtube that can give you some deeper insight into Flask, giving you tips, tricks and saving you time while condensing the information you need. 

For me personally I was a student of the Brooklyn Steam Center so I had the schoology app full of information for me to take in and review anytime I want, it was by far my greatest learning resource.

<h1>RoadBlocks in learning</h1>

Some challenges I faced while learning flask was obviously like anyone else, getting used to the syntax and logic. Since im not a computer it was difficult for me to understand why certain words went where they went or certain punctuations because a computer reads differently from a human even though the software we use tries to make it easier for us. 


Another roadblock for me was learning how the code I write interacts with a database since flask was the first time I had experience with something like that, now I had to make sure what was on the database corresponded to what I was coding and little things such as duplicate values in a database can cause errors in my code.

<h1>Social Media Project</h1>

For my social media project in steam I made a multi-page website with a functional database and webpage that sends specified information recorded to the database such as, passwords, birthday, usernames, photos, user ID etc. 

What ive gained from working on the project is that coding is ALOT of work and little stuff like syntax mis important down to a comma.
