Wall-e represents resilience and spirit through his actions of constantly fulfilling his duty in a world with no human interaction. When eve comes into the story it's the first time we see wall-e ever interact with something or to him someone thats "alive" and he shows emotion like a human, he gets excited and even falls in love, he also automatically gets the urge to want to teach eve about things she may not know to try and impress her.

Humans in wall-e portray the consequences of littering, not recycle and being irresponsible, eventually due to their neglect they have to abandon earth and give their dirty work to the robots. When wall-e finally gets on the ship it just shows how reliant human society is on AI, seeing them being handed everything and seeing them unable to stand being carried around by a chair showed the viewers the severity of how fall the human race declined.
